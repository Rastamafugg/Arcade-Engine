Update the pixel-canvas-zelda.html template in the GitHub project with the following changes:
- Make the second cave level enemies part of the same aggro group.
- Add a skeleton spawner on the third cave level and remove all existing enemies.  Keep spawning enemies from the spawner every 10 seconds.
- Add a fourth cave level, including stairs connecting to the third level, and add a boss.  Play an animation when the player first reaches the level with the boss threatening the player.  The boss should be a three phase boss, first they chase the player and attack with melee until defeated, then visually change and attack with ranged magic until defeated, then change visually again and spawn other enemies that attack the player until the boss is defeated.  Then play a victory animation.
