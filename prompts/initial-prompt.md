I want to define a reference template that will be the base for developing HTML canvas-based single file HTML pages that emulates pixel-perfect games.  I want to simulate an 8X8 pixel grid of a defined screen size that can be scaled to fit any window size, while maintaining a fixed ratio of x and y pixels.  Ideally, I would like to define sprites within this source file and be able to reference and place those sprites within the grid at defined x and y locations.  If this is feasible, please go ahead, otherwise, suggest more viable alternatives.
