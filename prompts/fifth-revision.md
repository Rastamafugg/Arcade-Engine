Add a HUD layer with a status bar: hearts for HP, coins, item slots — all rendered in the framebuffer using the palette system.

Add a particle system: pooled particles with velocity, gravity, lifetime, and palette color — usable for footsteps, portal sparkles, hit effects.

Add a quest/flag system: define named boolean flags, trigger scene state changes based on flag combinations, show conditional dialog branches.

Add a simple scripting layer: define scene event sequences (cutscenes) as arrays of timed commands — move NPC, show dialog, play SFX, transition scene.
